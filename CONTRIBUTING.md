# Translate Existing Content

You can clone or fork this repository, navigate to the `roadmap`, let's suppose you want to add a Mexican Spanish translation:

- Navigate to `roadmap/fundamentals/difference_compiled_vs_interpreted_languages/es_mx`,  
- Create the `es_mx` folder.  
- After completing the translation, be sure to name the Markdown file with the same name in English, but in Mexican Spanish in this case.
- Then add the new translation to the top (in the translations menu) of all the other files and commit your changes.
